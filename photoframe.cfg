supported_image_formats = .jpg,jpeg,.png,.gif,.heic,.dng,.tif,.bmp,
# This program supports any image format supported by ImageMagick.
# You can try adding any supported image format (lowercase only) if you need an image format that is not listed here.
# You should also remove .heic from this list if using on hardware with less than 1GB of RAM
supported_video_formats = .mp4,.mov,.avi,.divx,.xvid,.mjpg,.264,.wmv,.3gp
# The video capability is not intended to show full length video, but short video clips.
# The underlying video display engine is cv2, which uses the FFMPEG library, so any FFMPEG supported
# video format should work.  Above are the most typical, if you need support for a different FFMPEG supported
# format, you can add it here and see if it works.
max_memory = 128MB
# This parameter is so you can set the maximum amount of memory the ImageMagick pixel cache uses for low memory devices
# otherwise, the ImageMagick default is 1024MB if you leave it blank.  If it needs more than the defined max_memory
# it will use the SD card as virtual memory.  So, for my purposes, on a 1GB Raspberry Pi, I limited it to 128MB
# based on how much free memory I have when the program is running.
